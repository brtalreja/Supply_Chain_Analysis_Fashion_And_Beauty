# Supply Chain Analysis Using Data Visualization

## Overview

This project focuses on analyzing a supply chain dataset using various data visualization techniques. The goal is to gain insights into different aspects of the supply chain, such as sales, revenue, shipping costs, defect rates, and more.

## Data Preparation

### Reading and Preprocessing Data:
- Load the supply chain data from a CSV file.
- Generate descriptive statistics for the dataset.

### Key Statistics:
- Print and review key statistics of the dataset.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) performed:

### Revenue Analysis by Product Type:
- To visualize the relationship between price and revenue generated.
